This project aims to develop algorithmic trading models that crawl news articles to predict and trade the direction of stocks and financial instruments.
It also aims to utilize the [LangChain-ai](https://github.com/langchain-ai) and [Transformers(HuggingFace)](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)models to deeply analyze linguistic data from the financial domain and detect inefficiencies in the market.

## Key Features

- **Analyze the causes of price fluctuations**: Infer the causes of price fluctuations in your holdings from analyst reports, electronic disclosures, and news data, and automatically report them.
- **Real-time data collection and ultra-short-term trading**: Collect analyst reports, electronic disclosures, and news data in real-time to execute ultra-short-term directional trading strategies.

This project aims to use advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to reduce information asymmetries in financial markets and maximize the performance of quantitative trading strategies.
